      I had a good friend of mine who was trying to find a job database of his dreams. He had no other choice but to try all of them one by one in production. After trying 16 databases over several years they found something  pretty close to what they wanted. The bad thing was that due to the cluster-side replication of the technology selected (which apparently was discovered) they could not use more than 3 nodes. So they scaled the VMs up. And up. And once again. Until they maxed out on RAM. No, they didnâ€™t buy the mainframe. They discovered that there is Azure Data Explorer and that is not a standalone application. Happy end!
