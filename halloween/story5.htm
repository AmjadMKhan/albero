      Kafka is a new and shiny thing. It is everywhere. It can solve all our problems with data ingestion! Right? Almost. At-least-once delivery is still there. There was a nice story when one company decided to be very innovative and bring their Kafka to a new level. Actually, even two levels. They have implemented (at least tried to) a multi-regional Kafka cluster with cross-reginal replication. To make it more fun they put Kafka into containers. Now they are very busy every day ðŸ˜‰ Curiosity killed the cat (and in this situation the cluster) so now they are going to the other extremity PaaSing everything. Scary.
