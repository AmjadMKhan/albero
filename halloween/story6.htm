      If there were no problems, we would have to create them. And what is the best way to do so? Of course, to define some cool business requirements. One organization did exactly that. Their business division just decided to set an NFR to have processing, analysis and down streaming of incoming data within 100 ms. Do not ask me why. The coolest thing is that one of our teams helped them and they reached number which is a bit higher than this “business” requirement but at the same time way less than a second. Of course, that was done with Databricks. Everything can be done with Databricks, right, folks 😉 The small problem was the price. And not only for the compute itself but also for extraordinary amount of requests to Storage accounts. I bet that we will need a separate AI model just for cost predictions for running the first model 😉
